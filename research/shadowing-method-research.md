# Shadowing Method (影子跟读法) - Comprehensive Research Report

## 1. Scientific Basis of Shadowing

### 1.1 Definition and Origin

Shadowing is defined as "a paced, auditory tracking task which involves the immediate vocalization of auditorily presented stimuli" (Lambert, 1992). The learner listens to speech and repeats it as simultaneously as possible -- not after the speaker, but *with* the speaker, typically lagging by 200-400 milliseconds.

The technique originated in **interpreter training**. Lambert (1992) championed shadowing as a foundational device in the early stages of simultaneous interpreting (SI) training, describing it as "a paced, parrot-style auditory tracking task, conducted with headphones" that is nonetheless "an active and highly cognitive activity." Lambert even characterized simultaneous interpretation as essentially "shadowing in another language," while noting SI is "infinitely more complex and demanding on the cognitive level."

### 1.2 Key Researchers

### 1.3 What Happens in the Brain During Shadowing

#### The Phonological Loop (Baddeley's Working Memory Model)

Shadowing directly engages the **phonological loop**, a specialized subsystem within working memory that handles auditory and verbal information. The phonological loop has two components:

1. **Phonological store** -- maintains auditory memory traces briefly (these decay within ~2 seconds)
2. **Articulatory rehearsal system** -- analogous to subvocal speech; refreshes and revives fading memory traces

During shadowing, both components are activated simultaneously: the learner must hold incoming sound in the phonological store while simultaneously executing articulatory rehearsal to produce speech output. This dual activation strengthens the connection between perception and production.

#### Neural Pathways: The Dorsal Stream

Functional brain imaging reveals that shadowing operates through the **dorsal stream** -- a neural pathway that links auditory and motor representations of speech:

- Starts in the **superior temporal cortex** (auditory processing)
- Extends to the **inferior parietal cortex** (sensorimotor integration)
- Terminates in the **posterior and inferior frontal cortexes**, specifically **Broca's area** (speech production)

This dorsal stream creates a reverberant loop between frontal and posterior brain regions, coupling speech target formation with motor plan development in real time.

#### Motor Theory of Speech Perception

Shadowing aligns with the **motor theory of speech perception**, which proposes that speech is perceived not just through acoustic analysis but by mapping heard sounds onto the motor gestures required to produce them. During shadowing, the learner's attention shifts toward the "motions and gestures created during pronunciation of speech" rather than purely rhythmic/tonal characteristics.

#### Neural Plasticity Evidence (Maruyama et al., 2021 -- PMC)

A rigorous brain imaging study (119 participants, 27 days of 30-60 min daily training, pre/post MRI) found:

| Measure | Shadowing Group | Reading Aloud Group |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Brain region changed** | Left cerebellum (lobule VI) | Right anterior insula + right superior temporal gyrus |
| **Structural change** | Decreased gray matter volume | Decreased gray matter volume |
| **Working memory** | Significant decrease in N-back reaction time (= improved performance) | Similar improvements |
| **Interpretation** | Increased neural efficiency; "training-induced neural plasticity in phonological loop mechanisms" | |

The decreased gray matter volume paired with improved performance suggests **"usage-dependent adaptive selective elimination of synapses"** -- the brain pruning unnecessary connections to create more efficient neural circuitry. The left cerebellum changes specifically correspond to the articulatory rehearsal component of the phonological loop.

Key finding: **Shadowing produces measurable structural brain changes in as little as 4 weeks** of consistent practice.

## 2. Proven Step-by-Step Progression

### 2.1 The Three-Stage Model

Based on synthesis of Arguelles' method, Hamada's research, and practical frameworks:

#### Stage 1: Mumble Shadowing / Orientation (Weeks 1-2)
- **Goal**: Get comfortable with the rhythm and flow; overcome initial resistance
- **Method**: Quietly mimic the general rhythm without worrying about accuracy
- **Duration**: 5-10 minutes daily
- **Repetition**: Same audio 3-5 times per session
- **Focus**: Melody, stress patterns, and flow rather than individual words
- **Material**: Learner-oriented content (e.g., Assimil, graded readers, slow-speed dialogues)

#### Stage 2: Full Voice Shadowing (Weeks 3-6)
- **Goal**: Build articulatory muscle memory and pronunciation accuracy
- **Method**: Speak at full volume while maintaining upright posture
- **Duration**: 15-20 minutes daily
- **Key actions**:
  - Match speaker's pace, volume, and emotional tone
  - Optional transcript review for context (but do NOT read while shadowing)
  - Pause after phrases to repeat 2-3 times independently
  - Record yourself and compare to original
- **Material**: Natural conversational speed with moderate complexity

#### Stage 3: Real-Time / Free Shadowing (Week 7+)
- **Goal**: Automaticity; processing meaning while speaking simultaneously
- **Method**: Shadow continuously with no pauses; apply to fresh, unpracticed content
- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes daily
- **Key actions**:
  - Practice while walking or multitasking (Arguelles method)
  - Shadow unfamiliar material
  - Process meaning during shadowing (not just sound)
- **Material**: Native-speed content -- news, professional audiobooks, documentaries

### 2.2 Arguelles' Detailed 12-Step Beginner Sequence

Alexander Arguelles developed a more granular progression using structured courses (particularly Assimil):

1. **Blind shadowing** -- Listen and repeat without any text
2. **Shadow while reading translation** -- Read the L1 translation while shadowing L2 audio
3. **Dual tracking** -- Use thumbs to track both L1 and L2 text simultaneously
4. **Target language dominance** -- Reverse emphasis to prioritize L2 text
5. **Combined shadowing and reading** -- Shadow while reading L2 text
6. **Grammar analysis** -- Study grammar notes and complete exercises
7. **Oral reading** -- Read the target text aloud independently (no audio)
8. **Scriptorium method** -- Write out sentences while speaking them aloud
9. **Typing the lesson** -- Type the lesson content
10. **Correction** -- Compare typed material against original
11. **Silent reading** -- Read through for comprehension
12. **Passive listening** -- Listen without active repetition for comprehension consolidation

**Schedule**: Add one lesson daily, maintaining ~10 active lessons in rotation, completing an Assimil book in approximately three months.

### 2.3 Hamada & Suzuki's 16 Techniques Framework (2024)

Hamada and Suzuki classified 16 shadowing techniques into two categories based on the framework of **deliberate practice** and **skill acquisition theory**:

**Category A: Shadowing for Phonological Processing**
- Focus on sound perception, articulation, and bottom-up listening skills
- Appropriate for developing pronunciation and phonemic discrimination

**Category B: Shadowing for Intake Through Meaning-Focused Processing**
- Focus on semantic processing and comprehension
- Appropriate for developing vocabulary, grammar awareness, and top-down listening

This classification helps teachers and learners select the right technique for their specific learning goal rather than treating all shadowing as identical.

### 2.4 Difficulty Progression for Materials

| Level | Speech Speed | Sentence Length | Content Type | Comprehension Target |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Beginner | Slower than natural; clearly enunciated | 5-10 words | Language learning podcasts, children's audiobooks, graded readers | 80-95% |
| Intermediate | Natural conversational speed | 10-20 words | TED Talks, educational YouTube, podcast interviews | 70-85% |
| Advanced | Native speed, multiple speakers | Variable, complex | News broadcasts, professional audiobooks, documentaries | 60-80% |

**Critical principle**: Choose content **one level below** your current comprehension ability for shadowing. Shadowing material that is too difficult leads to meaningless parroting.

---

## 3. Input Comprehension and Shadowing Effectiveness

### 3.1 Krashen's Input Hypothesis and i+1

Krashen's Input Hypothesis holds that language acquisition occurs when learners receive input slightly beyond their current level (i+1). SLA research indicates learners need to understand **90-98% of input** for optimal acquisition. However, Krashen notes that effective input "need not contain only i+1" as long as the message is largely understood; the necessary i+1 is provided automatically through context.

### 3.2 The Comprehension Threshold for Shadowing

This is where shadowing diverges critically from general comprehensible input:

**Kadota (2007) and Hamada (2014, 2015) found that during shadowing, learners are directed to process sounds rather than meanings due to limited cognitive resources.** This is the fundamental tension in shadowing -- the simultaneous demands of listening and producing speech consume so much cognitive capacity that semantic processing is reduced.

This has major implications:

1. **Material must be largely comprehensible BEFORE shadowing begins** -- if learners don't already understand the meaning, shadowing becomes purely phonological mimicry with no connection to meaning
2. **Post-shadowing is more effective than pre-shadowing** -- Hamada (2014) found that practicing shadowing AFTER studying the content, structure, and vocabulary of the target passage is statistically more effective for low-proficiency learners
3. **The recommended comprehension range for shadowing material is 60-80%** before you start shadowing it, with some sources recommending even higher (80-95% for beginners)

### 3.3 Pre-Shadowing vs. Post-Shadowing

| Approach | Definition | Effectiveness | Best For |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Pre-shadowing** | Shadow the material BEFORE studying its content | Lower effectiveness, but builds phonological awareness | Intermediate+ learners who need pronunciation practice |
| **Post-shadowing** | Shadow AFTER studying content, vocabulary, and structure | Statistically more effective (Hamada 2014) | Low-proficiency learners; meaning-focused learning |
| **Combined** | Pre-shadow for sound familiarity, then study content, then post-shadow | Recommended by Kadota; combines benefits | All levels; optimal approach |

### 3.4 Practical Rule

**Before shadowing any material:**
1. Listen to it once or twice for global comprehension
2. Read the transcript/translation to understand meaning
3. Study unknown vocabulary and structures
4. THEN begin shadowing

Shadowing material you don't understand is one of the most common and damaging mistakes learners make. It trains your mouth but disconnects sound from meaning.

## 4. Spaced Repetition Integration with Shadowing

### 4.1 General Spaced Repetition Principles

The spacing effect demonstrates that repetitions distributed over time produce stronger memories than massed repetitions. Research suggests optimal review intervals of:

- **Session 1**: Initial learning
- **Session 2**: 1 day later
- **Session 3**: 3 days later
- **Session 4**: 1 week later
- **Session 5**: 2 weeks later
- **Session 6**: 1 month later
- **Then**: Progressively longer intervals

A useful heuristic: the optimal gap before review is approximately **10-30% of the desired retention interval**. If you want to remember something for 30 days, review it ~3-9 days after initial learning.

### 4.2 Applying Spaced Repetition to Shadowing

While there is limited direct research on spaced repetition specifically combined with shadowing, the following synthesis is supported by the evidence:

**Same-Material Repetition Within Sessions**:
- Shadow the same passage 5-10 times before moving on (Arguelles method)
- Diminishing returns set in quickly for same-session massed repetition
- After 5-10 repetitions, switch to new material

**Cross-Session Spacing (Recommended Schedule)**:
| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Day 1 | Study content + first shadowing session (5-10 repetitions) |
| Day 2 | Shadow same material (3-5 repetitions) + introduce new material |
| Day 4 | Review shadow of Day 1 material (2-3 repetitions) |
| Day 7 | Quick shadow review of Week 1 material |
| Day 14 | Spot-check shadowing of older material |
| Day 30 | Final consolidation review |

**Arguelles' Rotation System**: Maintain ~10 active lessons at various stages of the 12-step process simultaneously. As a new lesson enters the rotation, the oldest lesson cycles out. This naturally creates spaced repetition across the lesson set.

### 4.3 Key Principle: Interleaving

Research on spaced repetition shows that "inserting other items between repetitions produces superior recall." For shadowing, this means:

- Do NOT shadow the same passage for your entire practice session
- Alternate between 2-3 different passages within a session
- Mix passages of different difficulty levels
- Interleave shadowing with other study activities (reading, grammar analysis, free production)

## 5. Common Mistakes That Reduce Shadowing Effectiveness

### 5.1 Critical Errors

1. **Shadowing material you don't understand**
   - This is the #1 mistake. Without comprehension, shadowing degrades into meaningless parroting
   - Fix: Pre-study content to achieve at least 60-80% comprehension before shadowing

2. **Ingraining pronunciation errors**
   - Especially dangerous for beginners: mishearing L2 sounds and substituting the nearest L1 phoneme
   - Fix: Start with explicit phonics/phonology instruction; get corrective feedback from a native speaker or recording comparison early on

3. **Starting to repeat too early**
   - Trying to speak before hearing enough of the phrase to grasp its rhythm
   - Fix: Wait 0.5-1.0 seconds after the speaker starts before you begin repeating

4. **Rushing speed at the expense of pronunciation quality**
   - Sacrificing clarity to "keep up" with the speaker undermines the core purpose
   - Fix: Slow the audio to 0.75x if needed; prioritize accuracy over speed; gradually increase

5. **Speaking too quietly or mumbling**
   - Defeats the purpose of training articulatory muscles
   - Fix: Speak at full volume with clear articulation (exception: initial mumble shadowing stage is intentionally quiet)

6. **Using material that is too difficult**
   - Cognitive overload prevents any meaningful processing
   - Fix: Select material one level BELOW your current ability; you should understand 70%+ before shadowing

7. **No self-monitoring or recording**
   - Without comparing your output to the original, you cannot identify and correct errors
   - Fix: Record yourself regularly; compare against the original for pronunciation, stress, and speed differences

8. **Inconsistent practice**
   - Sporadic 2-hour sessions are far less effective than daily 15-minute sessions
   - Fix: Establish a daily routine; "15 minutes daily beats 2 hours weekly"

9. **Having no clear goal**
   - Shadowing without knowing what you're trying to improve (pronunciation? listening? fluency?) reduces focus and effectiveness
   - Fix: Set specific targets for each session (e.g., "match this speaker's intonation contour on sentences 1-5")

10. **Treating shadowing as a standalone method**
    - Shadowing is a supplement, not a complete learning system
    - Fix: Integrate with explicit instruction, free production, reading, and conversation practice

### 5.2 The "Going Through the Motions" Problem

**What makes shadowing ACTUALLY work vs. just going through the motions:**

| Just Going Through the Motions | Actually Effective Shadowing |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Mindless repetition of sounds | Active attention to phonological detail |
| No pre-comprehension of material | Material studied for meaning before shadowing |
| Same volume/energy every time | Matching speaker's emotional tone and energy |
| Never recording or comparing | Regular self-recording and gap analysis |
| Shadowing for 60+ minutes until fatigued | 10-15 minutes of intense, focused practice |
| Same passage forever with no progression | Systematic progression through difficulty levels |
| Sitting still, looking at phone | Upright posture, full engagement (ideally walking) |
| Mumbling under breath | Full-voice, clear articulation |
| No attention to prosody | Deliberate focus on rhythm, stress, and intonation |

## 6. Measuring Progress and Proficiency

### 6.1 Self-Assessment Methods

1. **Monthly Recording Comparison**
   - Record yourself shadowing a standardized passage each month
   - Compare against the original for: accuracy, timing lag, prosody match, fluency
   - Research indicates 40-60% pronunciation accuracy gains are achievable

2. **Shadowing Lag Time**
   - Measure the delay between the speaker and your reproduction
   - Beginners: 1-2 seconds lag
   - Intermediate: 0.5-1 second lag
   - Advanced: <0.5 second lag (near-simultaneous)

3. **Comprehension During Shadowing**
   - Can you understand the meaning while shadowing? (not just producing sounds)
   - This indicates cognitive resources are freed up from phonological processing

4. **Cognitive Load Indicator**
   - Notice reduced mental effort during shadowing sessions
   - When a passage feels "easy" to shadow, it's time to move to harder material

5. **Reproduction Accuracy Metrics**
   - % of words correctly reproduced
   - % of prosodic features matched (intonation contours, stress patterns)
   - Fluency: number of hesitations, pauses, restarts per minute

### 6.2 Automated Assessment

Research has demonstrated automatic scoring systems for shadowing (e.g., "Sensei" system) that evaluate:
- Articulation of individual sounds
- Lexical stress accuracy
- Spoken grammar proficiency
- Overall reproduction fidelity

These systems achieve correlations of ~0.8 with human assessor ratings (compared to ~0.91 for human-to-human agreement).

### 6.3 External Benchmarks

- **Comprehensibility**: Can native speakers understand you more easily over time?
- **Intelligibility**: Are your individual words correctly identified by listeners?
- **Accentedness**: Is your foreign accent reduced (though complete elimination is not the goal)?
- **Fluency markers**: Fewer pauses, faster speech rate, longer runs of connected speech
- **Standardized tests**: TOEFL Speaking, IELTS Speaking, or ACTFL OPI can track broader proficiency changes

### 6.4 Progress Milestones

| Phase | Indicator |
|-------|-----------|
| Week 1-2 | Can mumble along with slow, clear speech |
| Week 3-4 | Can reproduce individual phrases at full voice with acceptable accuracy |
| Month 2 | Can shadow full sentences at near-natural speed with text support |
| Month 3 | Can shadow without text for familiar material types |
| Month 4-6 | Can shadow unfamiliar material at natural speed with meaning comprehension |
| Month 6+ | Can shadow native-speed broadcasts/conversations; prosody closely matches original |

---

## 7. The Role of Prosody, Rhythm, Intonation, and Connected Speech

### 7.1 Why Prosody is Central to Shadowing

Prosody (the "music" of language -- rhythm, stress, intonation, pitch) is not an optional add-on to shadowing; it is **the primary mechanism** through which shadowing improves speaking and listening skills.

Research findings:
- Hamada (2011) found that regular shadowing led to **notable improvement in prosody, including intonation and rhythm**
- A systematic review found shadowing develops "specific elements of prosodic control, such as rhythm, intonation, production of weak forms in English, and use of pitch"
- Shadowing training improves **comprehensibility, intelligibility, and accentedness**, with the strongest effects on **suprasegmental features** (prosody, fluency) rather than individual sounds

### 7.2 Connected Speech Features Trained by Shadowing

Shadowing is uniquely effective for training connected speech because learners must match the speaker's natural flow in real time:

| Feature | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Linking** | Connecting words that flow together | "turn_it_off" |
| **Elision** | Dropping sounds in fast speech | "las(t) night" |
| **Assimilation** | Sounds changing to match neighbors | "don't you" → "donchu" |
| **Weak forms** | Unstressed function words reduced | "to" → /tə/, "and" → /ən/ |
| **Reduction** | Vowels in unstressed syllables become schwa | "banana" → /bəˈnænə/ |
| **Stress timing** | English rhythm based on stressed syllables | Content words stressed, function words unstressed |
| **Intonation contours** | Rising/falling pitch patterns for meaning | Questions rise, statements fall (simplified) |

### 7.3 Prosody-Focused Shadowing Technique

**Prosodic Shadowing** (as distinct from Content Shadowing):
- Focus ONLY on imitating prosodic features -- rhythm, stress, intonation
- Don't worry about reproducing every word accurately
- Hum or use nonsense syllables to match the melody
- Especially useful for learners whose L1 has very different prosodic patterns from the target language

**Content Shadowing**:
- Reproduce both the content (words) AND the prosody exactly as in the original
- Higher cognitive demand
- Appropriate for intermediate+ learners

### 7.4 Why This Matters for Listening Comprehension

Shadowing enhances the **decoding of connected speech**, including reductions, elisions, and weak forms. Many listening comprehension failures come not from vocabulary gaps but from inability to parse natural-speed connected speech. By forcing learners to produce these features, shadowing builds the mental models needed to recognize them in input.

## 8. Types of Shadowing and When Each is Appropriate

### 8.1 Core Types

#### Complete (Full) Shadowing
- **Definition**: The learner repeats everything the speaker says, as simultaneously as possible
- **Cognitive demand**: High
- **Best for**: Pronunciation accuracy, fluency development, articulatory training
- **When to use**: Once comfortable with the material; primary shadowing mode for most learners
- **Limitation**: High cognitive load may prevent meaning processing

#### Selective Shadowing
- **Definition**: The learner selects only certain words or phrases to shadow (e.g., content words only, or specific grammatical structures)
- **Cognitive demand**: Moderate
- **Best for**: Focusing on specific linguistic targets; reducing overwhelm for beginners
- **When to use**: When full shadowing is too demanding; when targeting specific features (e.g., only shadow verbs, or only stressed words)
- **Advantage**: Reduces cognitive load while maintaining phonological focus

#### Interactive Shadowing
- **Definition**: Paired activity where one student shadows another, adding questions and comments
- **Cognitive demand**: Very high
- **Best for**: Meaning-focused processing; conversational fluency; classroom settings
- **When to use**: Advanced learners; classroom pair work; when the goal is semantic engagement, not just phonological training
- **Advantage**: Forces learners to process meaning (not just sound) because they must respond appropriately

#### Prosodic Shadowing
- **Definition**: Imitating only the prosodic features (rhythm, intonation, stress) without focusing on exact words
- **Cognitive demand**: Low to moderate
- **Best for**: Intonation training; rhythm acquisition; beginners overwhelmed by full shadowing
- **When to use**: Early stages; when prosodic transfer from L1 is a major issue
- **Advantage**: Isolates suprasegmental features for focused practice

#### Content Shadowing
- **Definition**: Reproducing both the exact words AND the prosodic patterns of the speaker
- **Cognitive demand**: High
- **Best for**: Comprehensive oral skill development
- **When to use**: Intermediate to advanced stages when both accuracy and prosody matter

### 8.2 Timing Variants

#### Pre-Shadowing
- **Definition**: Shadow material BEFORE studying its content
- **Effect**: Builds phonological familiarity but limited meaning processing
- **Research**: Less effective for listening comprehension gains (Hamada, 2014)

#### Post-Shadowing
- **Definition**: Shadow material AFTER studying its content, vocabulary, and structure
- **Effect**: Stronger comprehension gains because meaning is already established
- **Research**: Statistically more effective for low-proficiency learners (Hamada, 2014)

### 8.3 Speed and Modality Variants

| Variant | Description | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Slow-speed shadowing** | Audio at 0.75x speed | Accuracy building; beginners |
| **Normal-speed shadowing** | Audio at 1.0x | Standard practice |
| **Fast-speed shadowing** | Audio at 1.25x | Automaticity; advanced challenge |
| **Walking shadowing** | Shadow while walking briskly outdoors | Builds automaticity through divided attention; Arguelles method |
| **Dialogue shadowing** | Practice both sides of conversations | Conversational pattern internalization |
| **Song shadowing** | Shadow music lyrics | Engagement; prosodic training; progressive difficulty (ballads to fast songs) |
| **Accent-specific shadowing** | Shadow speakers with target regional accent | Regional pronunciation goals |
| **Emotional shadowing** | Match speaker's emotional tone/energy | Natural expressiveness; pragmatic competence |

### 8.4 Decision Framework: Which Type to Use When

```
Is the learner a beginner?
  YES → Start with Prosodic Shadowing or Selective Shadowing
         Use Post-Shadowing (study content first)
         Use slow-speed audio (0.75x)

Is the goal pronunciation accuracy?
  YES → Full/Complete Shadowing with self-recording
         Content Shadowing for comprehensive practice

Is the goal listening comprehension?
  YES → Post-Shadowing (study content first, then shadow)
         Progress from Selective → Full Shadowing

Is the goal fluency and automaticity?
  YES → Real-time Full Shadowing with unfamiliar material
         Walking Shadowing
         Fast-speed shadowing (1.25x)

Is the goal natural prosody/intonation?
  YES → Prosodic Shadowing first
         Then Content Shadowing
         Emotional Shadowing for expressiveness

Is the learner in a classroom setting?
  YES → Interactive Shadowing for meaning engagement
         Paired activities with role switching
```

## 9. Summary: What Makes Shadowing Actually Work

### The Non-Negotiable Elements

1. **Comprehension BEFORE shadowing** -- Study the content first (post-shadowing approach)
2. **Appropriate difficulty** -- Material one level below current ability (70-95% comprehensible)
3. **Full-voice, clear articulation** -- Not mumbling (after the initial mumble stage)
4. **Attention to prosody** -- Actively match rhythm, stress, and intonation
5. **Self-recording and comparison** -- Regular feedback loop
6. **Consistency over intensity** -- 10-15 minutes daily beats sporadic long sessions
7. **Progressive difficulty** -- Systematic movement from easy to hard material
8. **Spaced review** -- Return to material at expanding intervals
9. **Integration with other methods** -- Shadowing is a powerful supplement, not a standalone system
10. **Physical engagement** -- Upright posture, ideally walking (Arguelles method)

### The Science in One Paragraph

Shadowing works because it simultaneously activates the perception-production link in the brain's dorsal stream, strengthens the phonological loop in working memory, and forces real-time integration of auditory input with articulatory output. It produces measurable neural plasticity (structural brain changes) within 4 weeks. The technique is most effective when learners already comprehend the material (post-shadowing), focus on prosodic features, and practice consistently in short daily sessions with spaced review. It particularly benefits bottom-up listening skills, pronunciation accuracy, prosodic control, and spoken fluency.
